<p id="description">This is a Java program that helps users find the fare and shortest route for travelling between two stations on the Delhi Metro </br>
&#x2022; The program utilizes Graph and Heap data structures to implement the functionality. </br>
&#x2022; The graph consists of nodes representing metro stations each containing information such as the station name metro corridor and connecting lines.</br>
&#x2022; The edges represent connections between stations with their costs corresponding to the distances between the connected stations. </br>
&#x2022; Various algorithms such as Dijkstra breadth-first search and depth-first search are employed to determine the shortest path between the source and destination stations. </br>
&#x2022; The fare is calculated based on the total distance travelled between the two stations. </br>
&#x2022; The program also provides a metro map for better navigation. The main code is implemented in the "Main.java" file while the heap implementation can be found in the "Heap.java" file.</p>
